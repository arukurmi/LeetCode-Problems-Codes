// Implement next permutation, which rearranges numbers into the lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers.
// If such an arrangement is impossible, it must rearrange it to the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).
// The replacement must be in place and use only constant extra memory.
